# Zindi Lacuna Malaria Detection Challenge
https://www.kaggle.com/code/noob786/zindi-lacuna-malaria-detection-challenge-ai?scriptVersionId=316457281
This project implements a YOLOv8 object detection model to identify malaria parasites in blood samples as part of the **Zindi Lacuna Malaria Detection Challenge**. The model is designed to detect and classify malaria parasites in microscopy images, helping healthcare professionals identify and manage malaria cases efficiently.

## About the Project

The Zindi Lacuna Malaria Detection Challenge is focused on leveraging machine learning and computer vision to solve healthcare problems in malaria diagnosis. Malaria remains a significant health concern globally, and early detection is critical. This project uses state-of-the-art YOLOv8 object detection technology to automatically identify malaria parasites in blood microscopy images.

### Key Features:
- **Real-time Detection**: YOLOv8-based model for fast and accurate parasite detection
- **High Performance**: Trained over 60 epochs with excellent convergence
- **Multiple Metrics**: Uses precision, recall, and mAP scores for comprehensive evaluation
- **Practical Application**: Can be deployed for diagnostic support and malaria screening

## Model Performance

The trained model achieves strong performance metrics on the validation dataset:

| Metric | Final Value |
|--------|-------------|
| **Precision** | 75.78% |
| **Recall** | 66.25% |
| **mAP50** | 74.62% |
| **mAP50-95** | 51.67% |
| **Training Epochs** | 60 |

The model shows consistent improvement throughout training with validation metrics stabilizing after epoch 40+.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Zindi-Lacuna-Malaria-Detection-Challenge-AI
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Requirements

The following packages are required to run this project:

- **ultralytics** - YOLOv8 object detection framework

### Additional Dependencies (Python):
```
ultralytics
opencv-python
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
torch
torchvision
```

To install all dependencies, run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Jupyter Notebook

Run the notebook to train the model, evaluate results, or perform inference:
```bash
jupyter notebook notebook.ipynb
```

The notebook includes:
- Data loading and preprocessing
- YOLOv8 model training
- Model evaluation and metrics calculation
- Inference on test images

### Python App

The `app.py` file contains the application code for deployment. You can extend it to:
- Create a web interface for predictions
- Set up API endpoints for model inference
- Build a real-time detection system

Run the application:
```bash
python app.py
```

### Model Inference

The trained model weights are stored in `best.pt`. You can use it for inference with the Ultralytics YOLO library:

```python
from ultralytics import YOLO

# Load the model
model = YOLO('best.pt')

# Perform inference
results = model.predict(source='image.jpg', conf=0.5)

# Display results
results[0].show()
```
